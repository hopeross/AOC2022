This year's attempt at doing the advent of code challenge.  I don't typically do well but hey I keep trying to improve my skills.

The plan is to use javascript.  I may move off of that depending on how things go.

Day 1: went well, I'm pleased with this
Day 2: code's ugly as hell and could use a refactor but it got the right answer
Day 3: hey I kinda like my solution for today
Day 4: a bit of a struggle honestly and it's back to being ugly as hell, but I'm keeping up with the developers at the office so I'm happy.
